Serialized representation of concepts

A statement is a noun, and states that that thing exists.
So, substituting English words, "Square" is a valid statement that translates to "There is a square"
Adjectives are easy, they behave as in English. "Red Square" means "There is a red square"
Verbs create nouns representing relationships. "cover square circle" means "There is a square covering a circle"
Verbs can take 1 or 2 nouns as arguments, depending on the verb
Adjectives can also describe verbs. "slow move red square" means "There is a red square that moves/is moving slowly"
Tense is represented by special adjectives, but is implicitly present/present progressive.

Adjectives can describe adjectives instead of a noun or verb, but this must be done explicitly using a Combine
"(Combine apply) very stupid man" means apply very to stupid and get "there is a very stupid man"
Anywhere a noun can be used a pronoun can also be used and applies to the last statement made that fits the pronoun's
criteria. (gender, number, animation, formality)
